# MoodWeather

MoodWeather is a simple React application that allows users to track their moods and log entries. The app includes a mood selector, a page to display entries, a graph to visualize mood trends, and responsive design for both mobile and desktop views. The background color dynamically changes based on the user's selected mood. All entries are saved locally in the browser's local storage, ensuring that data persists even after a page refresh.

- **Mood Graph**: A graph that visualizes mood trends over time.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
